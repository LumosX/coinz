### Game features:
(**Note:** Features in *italics* denote specification-requested features. All others are to be considered bonus features.)
* *Coins of the four fictional cryptocurrencies may be collected by walking within range.*
* *Collected coins are added to the respective "spare change" wallet balance.*
* *Coins from the "spare change" wallets may be deposited to the player's bank account.*
* *Deposits are limited to 25.0 total units of coins in a day.*
* *Coins from the "spare change" wallets may be sent to other players.*
* Upon registering for an account, the player selects a team. Teams provide different bonuses for players.
* The two teams differ in character and have different goals in the game's narrative *(more on this below)*.
* The player's bank account can hold balances in all five currencies: GOLD, DOLR, PENY, SHIL, QUID.
* Players may buy and sell any of the other four currencies for GOLD, at the daily rates, but after factoring in a commission percentage for the bank.
* All currencies can be used to purchase "Compute" (computing power) from team-specific "providers".
* "Compute" is then used to "decrypt" secret messages. Every message decrypted marginally improves the team's current position in the global struggle for victory.
* Whichever team decrypts most messages globally wins the game.
* Collecting coins, sending coins, and decrypting messages gives players "experience" points which are used for levelling-up.
* Increasing levels amplifies the team-specific bonuses received by the player.
* Wallet sizes, bank commission rates, and Compute prices are affected by the player's current level and team selection.
* Receiving coins from other players leaves a note in the player's "personal messages", serving a logging purpose. The sender's rank (title determined by his current level) is displayed as well.
* The game features a rudimentary narrative revolving around a missing nuclear bomb, named "Project Nocturnal Ziggurat", potentially held by terrorists.
* The first team, the "Eleventh Echelon", is a fictional division of the MI5 seeking to locate and retrieve the bomb before it falls into the wrong hands.
* The second team, the "Crimson Dawn", is a fictional group of high-tech mercenaries seeking to find the bomb and sell it to an unnamed buyer for a lot of money.
* The two teams feature distinct colour schemes: silver and black for the Eleventh Echelon, and crimson and black for the Crimson Dawn. The rest of the game's interface thematically fits, largely occupied by various shades of grey.
